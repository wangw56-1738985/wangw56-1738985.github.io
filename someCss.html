                President Trump welcomed home on Saturday an American pastor freed by 
                Turkey and said the release would improve relations with Ankara, but
                he denied any connection to the dispute between Turkey and Saudi Arabia
                over the missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

                With television cameras on hand to record the event, Mr. Trump invited 
                the pastor, Andrew Brunson, to the Oval Office roughly an hour after he 
                had landed back in the United States. In an emotional moment, Mr. Brunson 
                asked if he could pray for Mr. Trump, then knelt next to him and asked God 
                to give the president “supernatural wisdom.”
